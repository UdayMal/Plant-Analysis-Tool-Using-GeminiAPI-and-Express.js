# Plant-Analysis-Tool-Using-GeminiAPI-and-Express

PlantScan: The Plant Analysis Tool is a web-based application that leverages the Gemini API and Express.js to identify and analyze plant species from user-uploaded images. 

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic UI interactions, the app processes plant images to fetch detailed species-specific insights. 

Users can view the analysis on-screen and also download a comprehensive PDF report generated using PDFKit for offline reference. 

The application integrates file uploads with Multer, environment configuration via dotenv, and is optimized for ease of use and informative output.
